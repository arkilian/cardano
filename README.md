# Cardano Development Learning Repository

Welcome to your comprehensive guide for learning Cardano blockchain development! This repository will help you master Cardano development from fundamentals to advanced smart contract creation.

## 🎯 What is Cardano?

Cardano is a third-generation, research-driven blockchain platform built on peer-reviewed academic research. It features:

- **Proof-of-Stake Consensus**: Energy-efficient Ouroboros protocol
- **Layered Architecture**: Separation of settlement and computation layers
- **Extended UTXO Model**: Enhanced security and scalability for smart contracts
- **Native Tokens**: Create tokens without smart contracts
- **Strong Academic Foundation**: Built on formal methods and peer-reviewed research

## 📚 Learning Path

### 1. Fundamentals
- Understand blockchain basics and Cardano's unique features
- Learn about ADA cryptocurrency and staking
- Explore Cardano's architecture and the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model
- Get familiar with wallets (Daedalus, Yoroi, Lace)

### 2. Development Setup
- Install development tools (cardano-node, cardano-cli)
- Set up a local testnet environment
- Configure your development environment
- Learn basic CLI operations

### 3. Smart Contract Development
Choose your path based on your needs:
- **Plutus**: Haskell-based, most powerful and flexible
- **Aiken**: Modern Rust-inspired language, easier to learn
- **Marlowe**: Domain-specific language for financial contracts

### 4. Building dApps
- Off-chain infrastructure
- Transaction building and submission
- Integration with wallets
- Frontend development with Cardano APIs
